3.322mA
1,505 ohms
Becaue the resister that we have in the circuit is 1000 ohms you would subtract 1000 from the 1,505 and get 505 ohms of resistance in the LED.
The voltage drop divided by the resistance of the LED gave the current of 3.322 so there wasn't a difference in the current.
When the LED is changed the current significantly changed as well as the voltage drop. The RT value went from 1,505 ohms to 1,235. The current went from 3.322mA to 4.047mA. I think the resistance of the LED changed which caused the current to change as well. The modified LED has a different resistance which woudl also explain the change in voltage drop.
